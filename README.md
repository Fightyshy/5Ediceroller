# 5Ediceroller
As title states. D&D 5E Dice roller with character stats, outputs total value of dice roll, accounts for advantage/disadvantage, currently planned for rolling flat stat, skills, saving throws, and attacks. Most likely SRD+Expansions to refer to, maybe homebrew usage.

Mostly for personal virtual backup and version control practice. Likely to never see distribution outside personal use. Most probably not backwards compatible below API 23, tested on Pixel XL.
